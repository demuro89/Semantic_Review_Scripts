# Systematic_Review_Scripts
Repository with scripts for scraping and downloading pdf articles from main academic resources.

This repository is the results of several scripts written to help couple of academic researchers during a sistematic review.

We hope those scripts will help our collegues for the same purpose.

This repo as a main script "get_links.py" that scrap google scholar and retrieve all the main links with a specific keyword.

After those link are retrieved and saved into links.txt you can use one of the other links to download the correspondant pdfs.

We have written a simple script for some of the main resources:

- ieee explore
- arxiv
- acm
- springer
- direct download


This is not an official framework
